# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic JavaScript module on FreeCodeCamp.org 

**Thoughts:** It was good to finally start again with coding. It felt really satisfactory to finally finish this module. Tomorrow I'll start with the ES6 module.

### Day 2: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic ES6 module on FreeCodeCamp.org 

**Thoughts:** A lot harder than the basic JavaScript module, but interesting. Didn't got as far as I would've liked.

### Day 2.5: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Listened to the CodeNewbie and base.cs podcasts

**Thoughts:** Didn't have any time to code because of a busy day at work and in private. Wanted to stay in touch with programming so listened to two episodes of these podcasts.
